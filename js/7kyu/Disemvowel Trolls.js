  Title:
    Disemvowel Trolls
  Description:
    Trolls are attacking your comment section!
    A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
    Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
    For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
    Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

function disemvowel(str) {
  var reg = /a|e|u|i|I|o|O/;
  for(var i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    if(reg.test(str[i])){
      str = str.replace(str[i],"");
      --i;
    }    
  }
  return str;
}
